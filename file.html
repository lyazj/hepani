    <h1>Upload a file</h1>
    <p>To generate animation, we need a file in which one or more hign energy physics events are stored.</p>
    <p>By now, two types of file are supported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        running log from <em>pythia8</em> (
        <strong>plain text format</strong>, usually <strong>.txt</strong> or <strong>.log</strong>
        )
      </li>
      <li>
        HepMC2, storing HEP event(s) generated by <em>pythia8</em> (
        usually <strong>.hepmc</strong>
        )
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    What you see in index page is a VBS process generated by <em>pythia8</em>.
    While running <em>pythia8</em>,
    we redirected <tt>stdout</tt> (<em>pythia8</em> uses it to output running logs) to a writable path,
    thus a valid input for animation is generated.
    All events are stored in a HepMC2 file after <em>pythia8</em> exits normally, (if so, )
    which is also a valid input to be uploaded.
    </p>
    <p>Let's have a try!</p>

    <form action="/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Upload a file</legend>
        Select a type:
        <select name="type">
          <option value="py8log">running log from pythia8</option>
          <option value="py8log">HepMC2 file type</option>
        </select>
        <br />
        Select a file:
        <input type="file" name="input" />
        <br />
        Check twice and click:
        <input type="submit" value="upload" />
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  </body>
